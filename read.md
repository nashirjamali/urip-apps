# The Problem URIP Solves

URIP solves two fundamental problems that exist at the intersection of traditional finance and the on-chain world: **limited access to global markets** and **the high volatility of crypto assets**.

## üåç For People Who Want to Invest in Global Stocks

### The Problem
Today, investing in premier global assets like Apple stock, the S&P 500, or SEA stocks is incredibly difficult and expensive for most people outside of the United States. They face:

- **Complex brokerage applications** with extensive paperwork and verification processes
- **High fees** including account maintenance, trading commissions, and currency conversion costs
- **Slow settlement times** that can take days or weeks to complete transactions
- **Geographic restrictions** that prevent access to certain markets
- **Currency barriers** requiring expensive forex conversions

### How URIP Makes It Easier
URIP completely removes these barriers by creating a truly borderless and accessible global and SEA stock market on the Lisk blockchain:

- **Instant Access**: Anyone with a crypto wallet, anywhere in the world, can instantly buy tokenized versions of real-world stocks (like tAAPL) 24/7
- **No Geographic Restrictions**: Global access without the need for local brokerage accounts
- **Lower Costs**: Reduced fees through blockchain efficiency and automation
- **Faster Settlement**: Near-instant settlement times through smart contracts
- **Simplified Process**: No complex applications or extensive verification required

## üí∞ For People Who Hold Crypto Assets

### The Problem
Holding crypto assets like ETH is a high-risk endeavor due to:

- **Extreme price volatility** that can wipe out any staking gains
- **Market unpredictability** making it difficult to plan long-term strategies
- **Risk of capital loss** during market downturns
- **Limited options** for stable returns in the crypto space

To avoid this risk, users often hold stablecoins, but this makes their capital idle and unproductive, missing out on potential growth opportunities.
